## Registration Setup

Fork the repository by clicking "fork" in the top right. Change the name if you like.

Then go to the "Teams Registration" assignment on MyCourses and follow the instructions
there **carefully**.

### Common Registration Mistakes 

Your team **must** have a fork to work on --
if you try to do your work on the instructor's original repo, nothing will work and you will inevitably fail.
We will try to warn you if you attempt to register the instructor's repo for your team.

You **must** register, even if you plan to work alone. If you plan to work in a team,
we only need one of you to submit the registration. If you both submit it, that's OK too.
(If you both submit it, they obviously need to match.)

You **must** submit a plain-text file. That means a file like this one. (Preferably, use a .txt extension.)
You **cannot** submit a registration as a PDF (.pdf), Word document (.doc or .docx),
or rich-text document (.rtf). Our scripts have no chance of understanding these formats.

### Common Assignment Setup Mistakes

Make sure to read the A1 instructions carefully when they are released.
There are important setup steps you must follow before working on the assignment.
